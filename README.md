> Differential amplifier board developed for KNN Melprop


A multi channel differential amplifier board designed to work with tensometers in bridge circuit and with type J or K thermocouples. Supply voltage ranges from 12 to 15V, otput voltage at full swing can be regulated to 5V or more with supply higher than 12V. Variable gain set by on board dipswitch, independently for all channels.
The design is split into two sub-boards: 3T0K and 1T3K.  

3T0K consists of 3 tensometer amplifiers.  
1T3K consists of 1 tensometer amplifier and 3 thermocouple amplifiers. (Project dropped)
